Disclaimer:
I am very busy being interviewed and trying to find a job so I did not have all the time I needed for this exercise.
I am more than willing to answer any questions regarding the flaws of my design and implementation.

Packages:
 - babel - The intention was to use it for ES6 capabilities
 - body-parser - Enables binding data to an ejs page
 - chart.js - Presenting the chart on the ranktable page
 - ejs - Combining js with html
 - express - Server
 - jsonfile - Read & write the data files

Notes:
1. I've added a chart but did not actually hook it to the data.
2. I know the code needs to be splitted but I haven't gotten into it, sorry.
3. I barely touched the design. Should have picked some UI framework when I started (bootstrap etc)
4. I did not take care of data validation, error handling etc...
5. Since this is an exercise I did not take the most efficient route, nor did I use a database for the data.

To run use 'npm run start'

Enjoy ;)
